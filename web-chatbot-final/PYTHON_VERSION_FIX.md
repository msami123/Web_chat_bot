# 🔧 Fix Python 3.13 Compatibility Issue

## ❌ Problem:

You're getting a TypeError with httpx/OpenAI on Python 3.13.

This is a known compatibility issue.

---

## ✅ Solution:

### Option 1: Use Python 3.11 or 3.12 (Recommended)

Streamlit Cloud uses Python 3.13 by default. We need to specify an older version.

**Create a file named `.python-version` in your project root:**

```
3.11
```

Or create `runtime.txt`:
```
python-3.11
```

Then push to GitHub again.

---

### Option 2: Update Packages

Make sure your `requirements.txt` has:

```
streamlit>=1.31.0
openai>=1.12.0
scikit-learn>=1.4.0
numpy>=1.26.0
httpx>=0.25.0
```

---

### Option 3: Force Reinstall on Streamlit Cloud

1. Go to your app on Streamlit Cloud
2. Click "Manage app"
3. Click the menu (⋮)
4. Select "Reboot app"

This forces a fresh install of all packages.

---

## 🎯 For Streamlit Cloud:

### Create `.python-version` file:

1. In your project folder, create a new file
2. Name it exactly: `.python-version`
3. Content: `3.11`
4. Commit and push:

```bash
echo "3.11" > .python-version
git add .python-version
git commit -m "Use Python 3.11"
git push
```

Streamlit Cloud will automatically redeploy with Python 3.11.

---

## 🔍 Quick Check:

After deploying, the app should work without the TypeError.

If you still see errors, check:
- ✅ `.python-version` file exists
- ✅ Contains just `3.11`
- ✅ Committed to GitHub
- ✅ App redeployed

---

## 💡 Why This Happens:

Python 3.13 is very new (released October 2024) and some packages haven't fully updated yet.

Using Python 3.11 or 3.12 avoids these issues.

---

**After adding `.python-version`, your app will work!** 🎉
